# DashCam-video-Analysis
To create a powerful machine learning (ML) model for detecting stop signs in live dash camera footage using a pretrained YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries**
Ensure you have Python installed and the required libraries by running the following commands:
```
pip install opencv-python-headless
pip install numpy
```

**Step 2: Download YOLOv3 Weights and Configuration**
You'll need the YOLOv3 weights (`yolov3.weights`) and the configuration file (`yolov3.cfg`). These files can be obtained from the official YOLO website or a repository that hosts YOLOv3 weights.

**Step 3: Create a Python Script for Object Detection**
Create a Python script that loads the YOLOv3 model, processes dash cam footage, and detects stop signs. Here's a simplified overview of the script:

- Load YOLO model and COCO class labels.
- Load dash cam footage (replace with your video source).
- Detect objects in each frame, including stop signs.
- Apply non-maximum suppression to eliminate duplicate detections.
- Display the video with bounding boxes around detected stop signs.

**Step 4: Run the Script**
Save the script, making sure to replace file paths with the appropriate ones for your environment. Execute the script using Python to process the dash cam footage, detect stop signs, and display the video with annotations.

Note: Fine-tuning the YOLO model might be necessary to improve accuracy depending on the quality and conditions of your dash cam footage. You can also consider integrating this with a warning system for real-world applications.
